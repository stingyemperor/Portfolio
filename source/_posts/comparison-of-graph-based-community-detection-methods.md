# Description

Graphs are a natural way of representing many real-world systems, and detecting
communities allows us to analyze complex networks like social networks. Recently
community detection methods based on machine learning algorithms, in particular
Graph Neural Networks, which allow neural networks to operate on arbitrary graphs
have been gaining momentum. In this work, weâ€™ve selected the task of community
detection as an example of the applications of graph neural networks, with node
features and graph structure being merged into a rich network representation
