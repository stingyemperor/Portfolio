#### Description

The framework is based on the Mask RCNN algorithm, which is trained to recognize the objects and details in a user sketch and replace them with
high-quality, stylized versions. This allows users to create professional-looking sketches in a fraction of the time it would take to do so
by hand. This project contains a user study and the results are reflected in the paper below-
