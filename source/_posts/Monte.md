### **Description**

This project implements a Monte-Carlo ray tracer using WebGL. It includes features such as ray casting and ray tracing with final gathering.
The implementaion pays attention to interactivity and hence features the gui to interact with the implementation.

Here is a screenshow fron the monte-carlo ray tracer.

I also features a Mock3D program which applied a normal map to 2D image in order to give the appearence of depth. It features refractions, reflections as well as interactive panels.
